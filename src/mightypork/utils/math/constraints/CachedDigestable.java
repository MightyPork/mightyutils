/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for constraints that support digests. Digest is a small data object
 * with final fields, typically primitive, used for processing (such as
 * rendering or other very frequent operations).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Taking a digest is expensive, so if it needs to be done often and the value
 * changes are deterministic (such as, triggered by timing event or screen
 * resize), it's useful to cache the last digest and reuse it until such an
 * event occurs again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementing class typically needs a field to store the last digest, a flag
 * that digest caching is enabled, and a flag that a digest is dirty.
 * </p>
